1. Comment-first, then refactor
"I’m struggling to understand what this code does. Can you first explain it with comments and then make the variable names clearer?"

2. Refactor-first, then add tests
"Please clean up this messy code and then make sure it has proper test cases to catch errors."

3. Test coverage focused
"I want to make sure this logic handles edge cases — please add meaningful test cases first, and then leave TODOs for improvements."

4. Debuggability focused
"Help me debug this. Add print statements where needed, and mark areas that might be problematic."

5. Documentation and robustness
"Make this code production-ready by documenting what it does and adding tests to verify each function."

6. Full polish pass
"Please improve this code fully — make it easier to read, understand, debug, and maintain."

7. Goal achieved early (for pause-and-reassess logic)
"All I need is to better understand this code."
